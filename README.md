# Portfolio Website V2

## Description

This project consists of a rebuild of my personal portfolio website with the aim to update it to current, modern libraries and frameworks. It is built around the React.js library in order to structure my physical CV into a structured digital format.

This project will replace the functionality of my previous website and demonstrate my Front-End Skills to a higher standard.

## Features

This application showcases my personal qualifications, work experience and previous projects, as well as giving a biography on the main page. The project is written in TypeScript and React Components and dynamically rendered from strongly typed local data. Each section of the website is organised within its own path through React Router V6.

The project features responsive design through media queries to resize and rearrange elements in the DOM dependant on the device used to view the project. Animations are generally handled through Framer Motion to allow for entry and exits from the virtual DOM to be tracked.

## How to Use

This project will be hosted on a Netlify, harnessing a CICD pipeline through GitHub. In order to access the project users will navigate to the Netlify domain. The Projects page showcases previous completed projects along with links to their repos and live deploys, which can be interacted with.

## Technololgies

This project is written with TypeScript and the React.js library. HTML elements are coded through JSX and styled using SASS. React Router is used to handle routing and layering of views throughout the application. View animation and transitions are managed through the use of the Framer Motion animation library.

The project is hosted on the Netlify platform under a custom domain.
